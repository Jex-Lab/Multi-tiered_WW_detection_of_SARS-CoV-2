# Multi-tiered strategy for large-scale wastewater detection of SARS-CoV-2 in low-case settings provides confidence for public health actions

## Abstract

Wastewater surveillance has played a pivotal role in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 transmission worldwide. However, developing and implementing the methods underpinning these programs in regions with prolonged periods of low community transmission has proven challenging. In Victoria, Australia, wastewater surveillance provided early warning of unknown community infections and informed timely public health decisions to limit their spread when case numbers were low. To achieve this, we developed a methodological approach that was sensitive to extremely low viral loads and could readily identify false-positives within short turn-around times. Here, we describe the successful development, implementation and evaluation of analytic methods using RT-qPCR and amplicon sequencing in tandem with CRISPR DETECTR in an ongoing, large-scale surveillance program to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Victoria, Australia. Our study covers a ten-month period, from July 2020 to April 2021, and includes all state-wide health districts and prolonged periods with no known, active community cases among the ~6.7 million population.
